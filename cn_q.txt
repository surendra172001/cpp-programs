Islands

An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water . A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given island to any other island in the same group . Given N islands (numbered from 1 to N) and two lists of size M (u and v) denoting island u[i] is connected to island v[i] and vice versa . Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.
Constraints :
1<=N<=100
1<=M<=(N*(N-1))/2
1<=u[i],v[i]<=N
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers N and M
Line 2 : List u of size of M
Line 3 : List v of size of M
Output Return Format :
The count the number of connected groups of islands

Given a NxM matrix containing Uppercase English Alphabets only. Your task is to tell if there is a path in the given matrix which makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” .
There is a path from any cell to all its neighbouring cells. A neighbour may share an edge or a corner.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two space separated integers N  and M, where N is number of rows and M is number of columns in the matrix.
Next N lines : N rows of the matrix. First line of these N line will contain 0th row of matrix, second line will contain 1st row and so on
Assume input to be 0-indexed based
Output Format :
Return 1 if there is a path which makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” else return 0.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 100
Sample Input :
2 11

Connecting Dots
Send Feedback
Gary has a board of size NxM. Each cell in the board is a coloured dot. There exist only 26 colours denoted by uppercase Latin characters (i.e. A,B,...,Z). Now Gary is getting bore and wants to play a game. The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same colour. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:
1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj.
2. k is at least 4.
3. All dots belong to the same colour.
4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge.
Since Gary is colour blind, he wants your help. Your task is to determine if there exists a cycle on the board.
Assume input to be 0-indexed based.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers N and M, the number of rows and columns of the board
Next N lines : a string consisting of M characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.
Output Format :
Return 1 if there is a cycle else return 0
Constraints :
2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50
Sample Input :

Its Gary's birthday today and he has ordered his favourite square cake consisting of '0's and '1's . But Gary wants the biggest piece of '1's and no '0's . A piece of cake is defined as a part which consist of only '1's, and all '1's share an edge with eachother on the cake. Given the size of cake N and the cake , can you find the size of the biggest piece of '1's for Gary ?
Constraints :
1<=N<=50
Input Format :
Line 1 : An integer N denoting the size of cake 
Next N lines : N characters denoting the cake
Output Format :
Size of the biggest piece of '1's and no '0's
Sample Input :

Given a graph with N vertices (numbered from 1 to N) and Two Lists (U,V) of size M where (U[i],V[i]) and (V[i],U[i]) are connected by an edge , then count the distinct 3-cycles in the graph. A 3-cycle PQR is a cycle in which (P,Q), (Q,R) and (R,P) are connected an edge.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers N and M
Line 2 : List u of size of M
Line 3 : List v of size of M
Return Format :
The count the number of 3-cycles in the given Graph
Constraints :
1<=N<=100
1<=M<=(N*(N-1))/2
